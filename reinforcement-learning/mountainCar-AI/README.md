# mountainCar-AI
Building a reinforcement learning model to tackle the mountainCar environment from the OpenAI gym.

Reinforcement Learning solution of the [OpenAI's mountainCar](https://gym.openai.com/envs/mountainCar-v0/).

Inspired from [Sentdex's Reinforcement Learning tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/q-learning-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/).

## About

> A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.

## Q-Learning

### Hyperparameters:

LEARNING_RATE = 0.1
DISCOUNT = 0.95
EPISODES = 2000
epsilon = 0.5



## Performance

> CartPole-v0 defines "solving" as getting average reward of 195.0 over 100 consecutive trials. [source](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/)

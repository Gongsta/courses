Building a simple q-learning algorithm to beat pendulum in openAI gym.

Reinforcement Learning solution of the [OpenAI's Pendulum](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/).

## About

> The inverted pendulum swingup problem is a classic problem in the control literature. In this version of the problem, the pendulum starts in a random position, and the goal is to swing it up so it stays upright. [source](https://gym.openai.com/envs/mountainCar-v0/)

## Q-Learning

### Hyperparameters:

LEARNING_RATE = 0.1
DISCOUNT = 0.95
EPISODES = 2000
epsilon = 0.5



## Performance

> CartPole-v0 defines "solving" as getting average reward of 195.0 over 100 consecutive trials. [source](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/)
